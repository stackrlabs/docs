# Upgrade Guide

This page has instructions on upgrading your Micro-Rollup to a specific or latest versions of the Stackr SDK and CLI.

## Upgrading to v0.5.0

To upgrade your existing application to SDK version v0.5.0 from any older version, you need to perform a "squash fork". It basically is
a new registration and deployment of your application but using the previous latest state as the new genesis state.

<Callout type="info">
  Note: Before moving forward, if you wish to preserve your application's state,
  please follow the instructions in the "[Backing up your Micro-Rollup
  state](#backing-up-your-micro-rollup-state)" section below so you obtain the
  state JSON file for restoration.
</Callout>

1. Delete existing registration.

```bash
$ rm deployment.json && rm db.sqlite
```

2. Update the SDK version in your `package.json` and the Stackr CLI version as well.

```bash
$ npm install @stackr/sdk@v0.5.0
$ npm install -g @stackr/cli
```

3.  In your `stackr.config.ts` file, rename the `batchSize` and `batchTime` fields to `blockSize` and `blockTime` respectively.

4.  Update the `REGISTRY_CONTRACT` variable in your `.env` to point to the updated contract. Refer to [Network Configuration](/build/references/providers-and-rpc.mdx) for the new address.

5.  Re-register and re-deploy your MRU as a new application.

```bash
$ stackr register
$ stackr deploy
```

With this, you now have a new application with the restored state! âœ¨

### Backing up your Micro-Rollup state

To get your application's latest state dumped into a JSON file, follow these steps:

1. Update the SDK version in your `package.json`. If you are upgrading from version < v0.4.3, update to v0.4.3 first for this step.

```bash
$ npm install @stackr/sdk@v0.4.3
```

2. Try to boot up the application. It should fail with an error stating "SDK version mismatch with Vulcan" and will dump your MRU's latest state into a `latest-state.json` file.

3. Restore this dumped state JSON file as the new genesis state.

```bash
$ mv latest-state.json genesis-state.json
```
