# Building your first Micro-rollup

## Bootstrapping a new project

To create a new project, run the following command:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npx @stackr/cli@latest init
```

```bash [bun]
bunx @stackr/cli@latest init
```

:::

- Choose a template from the list and follow the instructions.

```bash [Terminal]
        _             _                        _ _
    ___| |_ __ _  ___| | ___ __            ___| (_)
   / __| __/ _` |/ __| |/ / '__|  _____   / __| | |
   \__ \ || (_| | (__|   <| |    |_____| | (__| | |
   |___/\__\__,_|\___|_|\_\_|             \___|_|_|

? Pick a template (Use arrow keys)
❯ Counter (Recommended)
  Token Transfer
  Empty

```

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use the `Counter` template.

- After this you'll be asked to enter a "Project Name", enter a name and press enter.
- You'll be asked to pick the Database after this, based on the Database you choose, we set up the project for you. For this tutorial, we will use `SQLite`. You can choose any database you want. For any other database, you'll have to manually change the database configuration in the `stackr.config.ts` file.

```bash [Terminal]
? Database Driver (Use arrow keys)
❯ SQLite (Recommended)
  PostgreSQL
  MySQL
  MariaDB
```

- You'll see some green checkmarks at this point and instructions to follow. Follow the instructions and you'll have a new project created.

```bash [Terminal]
✔ ⚙️  Set up MRU
✔ 🧹  Set up git
✔ ⬇️  Installed packages

Get started by running the following commands:

  1. cd uno/
  2. cp .env.example .env & modify values
  3. Register your rollup using npx @stackr/cli@latest register

```

## Setting up your config

- Let's `cd` into the project directory and first copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
- Update the following values in the `.env` file.
  - You can get the latest values listed in the [Providers and RPCs](/build/references/providers-and-rpc) Page.

```bash [.env]
PRIVATE_KEY=<PRIVATE_KEY>
REGISTRY_CONTRACT=<REGISTRY_CONTRACT>
VULCAN_RPC=<VULCAN_RPC>
L1_RPC=<L1_RPC>
DATABASE_URI=<DATABASE_URI>
```

:::info
`PRIVATE_KEY` is the private key of account you want to register and deploy the rollup with.

We don't store your private key anywhere. It's only used to sign the transactions and is stored in your local environment.
:::

- Now let's dive into the `stackr.config.ts` file.

  :::warning
  Ignore the warning for `./deployment.json` file not found. We will create this file in the next step.
  :::

- The `domain` in the config is used to create EIP712 Typed Signature over the inputs of actions. Feel free to tune this as per your requirements.

```ts [stackr.config.ts]
domain: {
  name: "<APP_NAME>", // [!code focus]
  version: "<APP_VERSION>", // [!code focus]
  salt: "0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef" // [!code focus]
}
```

## Registering your Micro-rollup

Now that we have set up the config, let's register the Micro-rollup.
Make sure you are in the project directory and run the following command:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npx @stackr/cli@latest register
```

```bash [bun]
bunx @stackr/cli@latest register
```

:::

:::info
This command will register your application on the registry contract. And update the `deployment.json` file with the latest values of `appId`, `appInbox` and `chainId`.
:::

You'll see a message that the application has been registered on the registry.

```bash [Terminal]
✔ 📝 Registered application on registry
✔ 🧰 Updated deployment.json
```

## Project Structure

- The `src` directory contains the code for your application.
- The `src/stackr` directory contains the code for the State Machines and State Transition Functions.

We don't enforce any specific restrictions on the naming of the files, but keeping files related to the State Machines and STF in the `src/stackr` directory is recommended.

```bash
├── src
│   ├── stackr
│   │   ├── machine.ts
│   │   ├── actions.ts
│   │   └── transitions.ts
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── stackr.config.ts
│   └── deployment.json
```

- `machine.ts` contains the `StateMachine` and `State` classes for your application.

  - Please make sure to export the `StateMachine` object from this file.

  ```ts [machine.ts]
  const myMachine = new StateMachine({ ... })

  export { myMachine };
  ```

- `transitions.ts` contains the `STF` (State Transition Functions) for your application.

:::warning
 it is recommended that the machine.ts or the file containing the StateMachine, doesn't import anything from @stackr/sdk instead uses @stackr/sdk/machine for the StateMachine, State, Transitions and other utility classes.
