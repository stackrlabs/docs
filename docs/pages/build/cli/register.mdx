# `register` [Register your Micro-Rollup with Stackr]

The `register` command is the most crucial command in the Stackr SDK. It is used to register your Micro-Rollup with the Stackr on-chain registry.

:::warning
Any application must be registered before beginning development as the Stackr-SDK uses the `AppInbox` contract address to function internally.
:::

## Usage

```bash
¬ª stackr register --help
USAGE
  $ stackr register [--envFile <value>] [--privateKey <value>]

FLAGS
  --envFile=<value>     [default: .env] Path to the .env file
  --privateKey=<value>  Private key of the account to be used to register the contract

EXAMPLES
  $ stackr register

  $ stackr register --privateKey <privateKey> --envFile <path>
```

## Example

```bash
npx @stackr/cli@latest register
```

This command reads your `stackr.config.json` file for project details and sends a transaction to Stackr's on-chain registry to deploy a new `AppInbox` contract for the application. All the blocks that the app produces will be sent to this contract.

### Deployment cost

In addition to gas fees, The deployment cost for the `AppInbox` contract is 0.1 ETH. Make sure you have enough balance in your account to deploy the contract. This ETH is sent to the Vulcan operator.

We have kept this fees in this initial phase to prevent spamming and to ensure that the operator has enough funds to run the network.

:::info
The deployment fees is dynamic and increases with the number of applications deployed on the network. if the same app operator tries to deploy more than 10 applications, the fees will become 0.05 ETH for each new application.
:::

### Output

```bash
‚úî üìù Registered application on registry
‚úî üß∞ Updated deployment.json
```

Once the registration is successful, a new `deployment.json` file is created in the root of your project directory. This file looks like this:

```json [deployment.json]
{
  "appId": 18,
  "appInbox": "0x808c6cc1299A76ec3D1f6D37d1786801fF8d8f86",
  "chainId": 11155111
}
```
