# `add bridge` [Deploy a bridge and register with AppInbox]

The `add bridge` command is used to set the Bridge contract in your AppInbox on-chain. This is helpful as the AppInbox only accepts ticket requests for L1 to L2 bridging from the known Bridge contract. 

## Usage

```bash
Â» stackr add bridge --help                                                                                                                             
USAGE
  $ stackr add [ENTITY] [CONTRACT] [--envFile <value>]

ARGUMENTS
  ENTITY    (bridge|hook) Entity to add to your App Inbox
  CONTRACT  Contract Address of the entity to add to your App Inbox

FLAGS
  --envFile=<value>  [default: .env] Path to the .env file

EXAMPLES
  $ stackr add bridge 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678

  $ stackr add hook 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678

  $ stackr add hook 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678 --envFile=<relative path to file>
```

## Example

```bash
npx @stackr/cli@latest add bridge
```

You'll be prompted to enter your bridge address.

```bash [terminal]
? Bridge Contract Address
```
Enter the address and hit enter. 

Output if it passes all the checks:

```bash [terminal]
âœ” ðŸŒ‰ Succesfully added bridge contract to AppInbox
```
