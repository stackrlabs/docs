# Changelog [What's new]

## v0.5.0 (and CLI v0.0.21)

> Upgrade guide: [here](/build/upgrade-guide).

#### Breaking Changes

- Blocks are now rolled up into batches by Vulcan every some fixed interval. Therefore, C3A and above confirmation levels are now received on the batch level from Vulcan and L1. [Learn more](/build/framework/batch).
- State Updates are now stored on the Block level and not Action level. In case of a chain revert, the state reverts to the last block having status equal to or higher than `Sequenced`.
- Renamed `batchSize` and `batchTime` fields in `StackrConfig` to `blockSize` and `blockTime` respectively.

#### Features / Improvements

- Pre and post Block execution hooks. [Learn more](/build/framework/state-machine/block-hooks).
- Ability to create empty blocks by setting `sequencer.enableEmptyBlocks` to `true` in `StackrConfig`.
- Add `logs` and `errors` fields to `ActionExecutionStatusEventArgs` interface.
- Make `syncer.slotTime` an optional field (in `StackrConfig`) having a default value of `max(1000, blockTime)` ms. If provided value is less than `1000` ms, it defaults to `max(1000, blockTime)` ms too.
- [CLI] Use dynamic linking for reduced Wasm binary size.

#### Bug Fixes

- Prevent concurrent sequencer ticks.
- Prevent concurrent Vulcan block submission ticks.
- Fix some types not being exported correctly from the build.

## v0.4.3

- [SDK] On MRU bootup, if SDK version does not meet Vulcan's minimum SDK supported version requirement then the latest state is dumped in a JSON file. This is useful to restore state in a new MRU deployment.

## v0.4.2 (and CLI v0.0.20)

#### Features

- [SDK] Expose `emit` function in STF that can be used to record custom logs.
- [SDK] Add fields `logs` and `errors` to `SerializedAction`.

#### Improvements

- [CLI] Minified bundled JS file to optimize Wasm binary size.
- [SDK] Removed redundant state computation to optimize Wasm execution.

## v0.2.18-alpha to v0.4.1, CLI v0.0.19 and more

### SDK

#### Breaking Changes

- Consolidate BlockEntity boolean fields into status
- Merged the boolean fields `isAcknowledgedByVulcan`, `isFinalized`, `isRejected`, `isSubmitting` into `BlockStatus` itself.
- Added `Proposed`, `Submitting` and `Rejected` to `BlockStatus`.
- Change `BlockStatus.Unknown` -> `BlockStatus.Proposed`.

#### Features

- feat: `C3B` confirmation now comes on Consensus Layer finalization
- feat: Prune `state_updates` for old finalized blocks
  - Remove all the state updates for actions in the finalized block once it receives C3B. This makes the datastore lighter.
- feat: Store `fuelConsumed` in DB along with BlockData
- feat: store `l1BlockNumber` and use it for query while doing C3B finalization
- feat: add `Block` object (_containing height, timestamp and parentHash_) in STF
- feat: new Bridge plugin
- feat: expose `actions.query` in MicroRollupResponse

### CLI
