# Changelog [What's new]

## v0.5.2 (and CLI v0.1.2)

#### Breaking Changes

- Revamp the fields in [`StackrConfig`](/build/framework/config) and arguments to [`MicroRollup`](/build/framework/micro-rollup) constructor. See [upgrade guide](/build/upgrade-guide).
- Remove `previousStateRoot` and `newStateRoot` fields from `ExecutorEvents.EXECUTE_ACTION` event payload ([`ExecuteActionEventArgs`](/build/framework/events/#executoreventsexecute_action)).

#### Features / Improvements

- Expose `emit` in block hooks as well (previously it was available only in STFs). [Learn more](/build/framework/state-machine/block-hooks#custom-execution-logs).
- Add ability to [unsubscribe](/build/framework/events#unsubscribing-to-events) or [inspect active listeners](/build/framework/events#unsubscribing-to-events) to MRU events.
- Perform C2, C3A and C3B syncs for stale blocks on MRU start-up. This is useful to quickly sync latest states if you re-run the MRU after some time.
- Add `previousState`, `previousStateRoot` and `executionHooksLogs` fields to `ExecutorEvents.EXECUTE_BLOCK` event payload ([`ExecuteBlockEventArgs`](/build/framework/events/#executoreventsexecute_block)).
- The `sequencer.tick()` method exposed in `MicroRollupResponse` now returns a boolean value indicating whether a new block was sequenced or not.
- [CLI] New `verify` command: Verify that the source state machine binary matches with the registered binary on AppInbox. [Learn more](https://github.com/stackrlabs/cli/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#stackr-verify-appinboxcontract).

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixes a bug where it was possible to force create an empty block by returning an empty list of actions from sequencer strategy.
- [Playground] Fix state rendering for non-JSON state.

## v0.5.1 (and CLI v0.1.1)

- [SDK] fix: get missing `block.batchInfo` from `actions.query()`
- [CLI] feat: Add Windows support for `stackr` CLI commands and improve error handling.
- [CLI] feat: add `--envFile` flag to all commands to load environment variables from a different file than `.env`

## v0.5.0 (and CLI v0.1.0)

> Upgrade guide: [here](/build/upgrade-guide).

#### Breaking Changes

- Blocks are now rolled up into batches by Vulcan every some fixed interval. Therefore, C3A and above confirmation levels are now received on the batch level from Vulcan and L1. [Learn more](/build/framework/batch).
- State Updates are now stored on the Block level and not Action level. In case of a chain revert, the state reverts to the last block having status equal to or higher than `Sequenced`.
- Renamed `batchSize` and `batchTime` fields in `StackrConfig` to `blockSize` and `blockTime` respectively.

#### Features / Improvements

- Pre and post Block execution hooks. [Learn more](/build/framework/state-machine/block-hooks).
- Ability to create empty blocks by setting `sequencer.enableEmptyBlocks` to `true` in `StackrConfig`.
- Add `logs` and `errors` fields to `ActionExecutionStatusEventArgs` interface.
- Make `syncer.slotTime` an optional field (in `StackrConfig`) having a default value of `max(1000, blockTime)` ms. If provided value is less than `1000` ms, it defaults to `max(1000, blockTime)` ms too.
- Add `C1X` as a new action confirmation level that represents failed execution.
- [CLI] Use dynamic linking for reduced Wasm binary size.

#### Bug Fixes

- Prevent concurrent sequencer ticks.
- Prevent concurrent Vulcan block submission ticks.
- Fix some types not being exported correctly from the build.

## v0.4.3

- [SDK] On MRU bootup, if SDK version does not meet Vulcan's minimum SDK supported version requirement then the latest state is dumped in a JSON file. This is useful to restore state in a new MRU deployment.

## v0.4.2 (and CLI v0.0.20)

#### Features

- [SDK] Expose `emit` method in STF that can be used to record custom logs. [Learn more](/build/framework/global-variables/#custom-execution-logs).
- [SDK] Add fields `logs` and `errors` to `SerializedAction`.
- [SDK] Expose [`waitFor`](/build/framework/micro-rollup-utils#ackwaitforconfirmationstatus-actionconfirmationstatus) method in the `SerializedAcknowledgement` object returned from `submitAction`.

#### Improvements

- [CLI] Minified bundled JS file to optimize Wasm binary size.
- [SDK] Removed redundant state computation to optimize Wasm execution.

## v0.2.18-alpha to v0.4.1, CLI v0.0.19 and more
