# Stackr Config [Parameters of the Micro-Rollup]

The `stackr.config.ts` file is the main configuration file for the micro-rollup. It contains all the parameters that are used to configure the micro-rollup.

## Example:

```ts [stackr.config.ts]
const stackrConfig: StackrConfig = {
  sequencer: {
    blockSize: 16,
    blockTime: 10,
    enableEmptyBlocks: true,
  },
  syncer: {
    slotTime: 1000,
    vulcanRPC: process.env.VULCAN_RPC as string,
    L1RPC: process.env.L1_RPC as string,
  },
  operator: {
    accounts: [
      {
        privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string,
        purpose: KeyPurpose.BATCH,
        scheme: SignatureScheme.ECDSA,
      },
    ],
  },
  domain: {
    name: "Stackr MVP v0",
    version: "1",
    salt: "0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
  },
  datastore: {
    type: "sqlite",
    uri: process.env.DATABASE_URI,
  },
  registryContract: REGISTRY_CONTRACT,
  preferredDA: DA.AVAIL,
  logLevel: "log",
};
```

where the type definition of `StackrConfig` is as follows:

```ts
interface StackrConfig {
  isSandbox?: boolean;
  deploymentFile?: string;
  sequencer: {
    blockSize: number;
    blockTime: number;
    enableEmptyBlocks?: boolean;
    disableBuilder?: boolean;
  };
  syncer: {
    slotTime?: number;
    vulcanRPC: string;
    L1RPC: string;
    disableVulcanSync?: boolean;
    disableL1Sync?: boolean;
  };
  registryContract: string;
  operator: {
    accounts: Account[];
  };
  domain: {
    name: string;
    version: string;
    salt: string;
  },
  datastore: {
    type?: 'sqlite' | 'postgres' | 'mysql' | 'mariadb';
    uri: string;
  };
  preferredDA?: 'avail' | 'celestia';
  logLevel?: 'log' | 'error' | 'warn' | 'debug' | 'verbose';
}
```

## Parameters

1. `isSandbox`: A boolean flag to indicate if the rollup is running in a sandbox environment. Defauts to `false`.

When running in a sandbox mode, the rollup creates a temporary sqlite database to store the state and the actions and the blocks are not sent to Vulcan or L1 for verification.
This is useful for testing and debugging purposes.

---

2. `deploymentFile`: Path to the deployment file containing the `appId`, `appInbox` and `chainId` of the micro-rollup. Defaults to `deployment.json`.

This file is created automatically during registration of the micro-rollup with the registry contract using `stackr register` command. See [Register](/build/cli/register) for more details.

---

3. `sequencer`: Contains the parameters for the sequencer module.

- `blockSize`: The number of actions that the sequencer picks up in a single block.
- `blockTime`: The time interval after which the sequencer picks up the actions in a block.
- `enableEmptyBlocks`: A flag to allow creation of empty blocks (the one with no actions).
- `disableBuilder`: A flag to indicate if the rollup should not use the builder to generate new blocks. This is useful for functionally generating blocks when needed. Defauts to `false`.

---

4. `syncer`: Contains the parameters for the syncer module.

- `slotTime`: The time interval after which the rollup sends a block to Vulcan for verification and finalization.
- `vulcanRPC`: The RPC endpoint of the Vulcan chain. Can be found in [Network Configuration](/build/references/providers-and-rpc).
- `L1RPC`: The RPC endpoint of the L1 chain. Can be found in [Network Configuration](/build/references/providers-and-rpc).
- `disableVulcanSync`: A flag to indicate if the rollup should not sync with Vulcan. This happens by default in sandbox mode. Defauts to `false`.
- `disableL1Sync`: A flag to indicate if the rollup should not sync with the L1 chain. This happens by default in sandbox mode. Defauts to `false`.

---

5. `operator`: Contains the parameters for the operator module.

- `accounts`: Contains the private key of the operator account. This private key is used for registration and batch signing

---

6. `domain`: Contains the parameters for the EIP-712 domain.

- `name`: The name of the micro-rollup
- `version`: The version of the micro-rollup
- `salt`: A random salt value

The other fields `chainId` and `verifyingContract` required by EIP-712 domain definition are taken from the given deployment file.

---

7. `datastore`: Contains the parameters for the datastore module.

This is used for local storage of the micro-rollup state, actions and blocks

---

8. `registryContract`: The address of the registry contract.

Can be found in [Network Configuration](/build/references/providers-and-rpc).

---

9. `preferredDA`: The preferred data availability layer

We currently support two data availability layers -

1. Avail (default)
2. Celestia

with more support of data availability layers coming soon. No additional configuration is required beyond selecting the preferred data availability layer.

---

10. `logLevel`: The log level of the micro-rollup. Defaults to `log`.

This is used for viewing the logs of the micro-rollup during runtime. Logs are a useful tool for debugging and monitoring the micro-rollup and checking for any errors.
