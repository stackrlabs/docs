# Events Framework [Get granular insights into the Micro-Rollup]

Stackr provides a really powerful events framework that allows developers to get granular insights into the Micro-Rollup's working. This framework is designed to provide a detailed view of the state transitions that are happening within the Micro-Rollup.

## Subscribing to events

You can subscribe to specific events by using the `events` utility returned by the rollup instance like this

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts [index.ts]
import { ConfirmationEvents } from "@stackr/sdk";

const rollup = await MicroRollup({
  config: stackrConfig,
  actionSchemas: [UpdateCounterSchema],
  stateMachines: [machine],
});

await rollup.init();

// subscribe to Confirmation event
rollup.events.subscribe(ConfirmationEvents.C0, (args) => { // [!code focus]
  // take any action here with args // [!code focus]
  console.log("C0 event fired", args); // [!code focus]
}); // [!code focus]
```

## Event Types and Arguments

This framework supports a variety of events that cover different aspects of the Micro-Rollup's operation, from action submission to block acknowledgment by the Vulcan system.

- `actionHash`: Hash of the action.
- `msgSender`: Address of the sender.
- `signature`: Signature of the action.
- `payload`: Input types allowed for the action.
- `state`: Current state or relevant state information pertaining to the action.

### `ConfirmationEvents.C2`

**Event Arguments:** `C2EventArgs`

- Similar to `ConfirmationEvents.C2`, focusing on exceptional or adjusted block data.

### `ConfirmationEvents.C3A`

Triggered when the block body data is settled on DA layer

**Event Arguments:** `C3EventArgs`

- `block`: Data of the block awaiting final confirmation.
- `vulcanResponse`: Optional response from Vulcan, if applicable, that may influence the final confirmation status.

### `ConfirmationEvents.C3B`

Triggered when an action's block receives final confirmation from ethereum. This event marks the completion of the confirmation process and finalizes the block within the chain.

**Event Arguments:** `C3EventArgs`

- `block`: Data of the confirmed block.
- `vulcanResponse`: Optional response from Vulcan that confirms or details the final status of the block.

## Executor Events
