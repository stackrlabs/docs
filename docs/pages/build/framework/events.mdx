# Events Framework [Get granular insights into the Micro-Rollup]

Stackr provides a really powerful events framework that allows developers to get granular insights into the Micro-Rollup's working. This framework is designed to provide a detailed view of the state transitions that are happening within the Micro-Rollup.

## Subscribing to events

You can subscribe to specific events by using the `events` utility returned by the rollup instance like this

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts [index.ts]
import { ConfirmationEvents } from "@stackr/sdk";

const rollup = await MicroRollup({
  config: stackrConfig,
  actionSchemas: [UpdateCounterSchema],
  stateMachines: [machine],
});

await rollup.init();

// subscribe to Confirmation event
rollup.events.subscribe(ConfirmationEvents.C0, (args) => { // [!code focus]
  // take any action here with args // [!code focus]
  console.log("C0 event fired", args); // [!code focus]
}); // [!code focus]
```

## Unsubscribing from events

You can unsubscribe from an existing event subscription like this

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
const listener = (args) => {...};
rollup.events.subscribe(ConfirmationEvents.C0, listener); // previously subscribed event

/**
 * Some logic in between
 */

rollup.events.unsubscribe(ConfirmationEvents.C0, listener); // [!code focus]
```

## Inspecting active subscriptions

You can inspect all active subscriptions for a particular event like this

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
const listeners: { name: string, code: string }[] = rollup.events.getListeners(ConfirmationEvents.C0);
```

## Event Types and Arguments

This framework supports a variety of events that cover different aspects of the Micro-Rollup's operation, from action submission to block acknowledgment by the Vulcan system.

## Confirmation Events

Detailed events tracking the various stages of action confirmation, providing insights into each phase of the confirmation process within the Micro-Rollup.

### `ConfirmationEvents.C0`

Triggered when action receives and acknowledgement from the rollup operator

**Event Arguments:** `C0EventArgs`

- `actionName`: Name of the action being confirmed.
- `actionHash`: Hash of the action.
