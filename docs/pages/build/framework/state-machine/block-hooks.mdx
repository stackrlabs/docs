# Block Hooks

Blocks hooks are functions (Similar to [State transition functions](/build/framework/state-machine/state-transitions)) that are automatically executed before or after the execution of all the actions on the block as per configuration. Hooks are executed once per block and a representation of the same is stored in Block Headers for verification later.

:::warning
Unlike STFs, hooks are not supposed to fail. If a hook fails, the block execution fails too.

## Hooks in Stackr

Our SDK provides a way to create execution hooks for the blocks.

A basic hook in Stackr looks like this:

```ts [hooks.ts]
import { Hook, Hooks } from "@stackr/sdk/machine";
import { CounterState } from "./machine";

const addTwo: Hook<CounterState> = {
  handler: ({ state }) => {
    state += 2;
    return state;
  },
};

const minusTwo: Hook<CounterState> = {
  handler: ({ state }) => {
    state -= 2;
    return state;
  },
};

export const hooks: Hooks<CounterState> = {
  addTwo,
  minusTwo,
};
```

In the above example, we have two hooks `addTwo` and `minusTwo`. These hooks have a handler, and they take in current state, applies the hook logic & return the new state.

## Hooks in Detail

The most important part of the Hooks is the `handler` function. This function only has access to the current state & the blockInfo `height`, `timestamp` & `parentHash`. Like State Transition Functions, they should be pure functions too & should return the new state after the applying the logic.

:::warning
There is no execution status for the hooks. If a hook execution fails, then the block execution fails too.

## Defining the Hooks for MicroRollup

To configure these hooks, `hooks` has to be passed in [StateMachine](/build/framework/state-machine/introduction#state-machines-in-stackr) & then `pre` & `post` hooks can be defined as follows on the MircoRollup :

```ts [mru.ts]
const mru = await MicroRollup({
  config: stackrConfig,
  actionSchemas: [UpdateCounterSchema],
  stateMachines: [machine],
  blockHooks: // [!code hl] {
    pre: ["addTwo"], // [!code hl]
    post: ["minusTwo"], // [!code hl]
  },// [!code hl]
});
```

In this case, we call `addTwo` before and `minusTwo` after the block is executed. Mutliple hooks can be added for both of the triggers by just passing the hook name as string in the array.

:::info
When dealing with multiple hooks, ensure that the names of the hooks in the array are passed in the order corresponding to their intended execution.

## Variables available inside a block hook

There are 3 special variables which always exist inside the handler of a block hook. These can be used by the developer to write the logic of a block hook:

1. `state`
2. `block`
    - `block.height`
    - `block.timestamp`
    - `block.parentHash`
3. `emit`

```tsx twoslash [hooks.ts]
// @noErrors
type MachineState = unknown;

interface Hook<MachineState> {
  handler: (props: {
    state: MachineState;
    block: {
      height: number;
      timestamp: number;
      parentHash: BytesLike;
    };
    emit: (ExecutionLog) => void; 
  }) => MachineState;
}
// ---cut---
// Without Destructuring
const superCoolBlockHook: Hook<MachineState> = {
  handler: (props) => {
    const state = props.
    //                  ^|




    const height = props.block.
    //                         ^|
  },
};


// With Destructuring
const anotherSuperCoolBlockHook: Hook<MachineState> = {
  handler: ({ s }) => {
    //         ^|
  },
};
```

### State

1. `state` : The entire current state of the state machine in wrapped format. This is the state that the block hook is supposed to modify.

:::info
A block hook receives a cloned version of the state, and it must return the modified state to update the state of the state machine.
:::

### Block Properties

A `block` object containing the current block height, timestamp and the parent block's hash is passed as an argument to the hook. These can be used to generate pseudo-random numbers or to implement time-based logic.

1. `block.height` : The height of the block.

2. `block.timestamp` : The timestamp of the block.

3. `block.parentHash` : The hash of the parent block of the block.

### Custom Execution Logs

The `emit` variable passed to a hook is a method that can be used to record custom execution logs (later accessible at [`block.hooksLogs`](/build/framework/block)).

Example usage:

```ts [hooks.ts]
const checkEven: Hook<CounterState> = {
  // [!code word:emit]
  handler: ({ state, emit }) => {
    if (state % 2 === 0) {
      emit({ name: "is_even", value: state });
    }
    return state;
  },
};
```
