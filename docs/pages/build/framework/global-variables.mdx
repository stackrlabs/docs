# Global Variables [Available inside the State Transition Function]

There are special variables which always exist inside the handler of the State transition function. These can be used by the developer to write the logic of the state transition function:

There are a total of 6 variables available inside the state transition function:

1. `state`
2. `msgSender`
3. `inputs`
4. `signature`
5. `block`
    - `block.height`
    - `block.timestamp`
    - `block.parentHash`
6. `emit`

```ts twoslash [transitions.ts]
// @noErrors
type MachineState = unknown;
type InputTypes = any;

interface STF<MachineState, InputTypes> {
  handler: (props: {
    state: MachineState;
    msgSender: string;
    inputs: InputTypes;
    signature: string;
    block: {
      height: number;
      timestamp: number;
      parentHash: BytesLike;
    }
  }) => MachineState;
}
// ---cut---
// Without Destructuring
const superCoolStf: STF<MachineState, InputTypes> = {
  handler: (props) => {
    const state = props.
    //                  ^|




    const height = props.block.
    //                         ^|
  },
};


// With Destructuring
const anotherSuperCoolStf: STF<MachineState, InputTypes> = {
  handler: ({ s }) => {
    //         ^|
  },
};
```

## State

1. `state` : The entire current state of the state machine in wrapped format. This is the state that the state transition function is supposed to modify.

:::info
The STF receives a cloned version of the state, and the state transition function must return the modified state to update the state of the state machine.
:::

## Action Data

When an action is dispatched, the inputs are passed to the state transition function. The inputs are the parameters passed to the action schema.

1. `msgSender` : The address of the sender of the transaction.

2. `inputs` : The inputs passed to the action schema.

3. `signature` : The signature of the msgSender on the inputs.

:::info
In the current version of the SDK, the `msgSender` is the same as the account that signs the input payload. In future iterations someone could submit the payload on behalf of another account which signed the payload.
:::

## Block Properties

A `block` object containing the current block height, timestamp and the parent block's hash is passed as an argument to the state transition function. These can be used to generate pseudo-random numbers or to implement time-based logic.

1. `block.height` : The height of the block in which the transaction is included.

2. `block.timestamp` : The timestamp of the block in which the transaction is included.

3. `block.parentHash` : The hash of the parent block of the block in which the transaction is included.

## Custom Execution Logs

The `emit` variable passed to STF is a method that can be used to record custom execution logs (later accessible at [`action.logs`](/build/framework/action/serialized-action#actionlogs)).

Example usage:

```tsx [transitions.ts]
const increment: STF<CounterState> = {
  // [!code word:emit]
  handler: ({ state, inputs, emit }) => {
    state += inputs.amount;
    emit({ name: "incremented", value: inputs.amount });
    return state;
  },
};
```

### Bonus: Pseudo-Random Number Generation

The `block.parentHash` can be used to generate pseudo-random numbers. The hash of the parent block is used as a seed to generate pseudo-random numbers. This is useful when you need to generate random numbers in a deterministic way. This is subjected to change with VRF implementation in the future.
